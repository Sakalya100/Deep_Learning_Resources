# CampusX Object Detection Sessions

## Lecture 1
The lecture was an introductory lecture covering the basic concepts of the evolution of object detection leading to discussion of the entire object detection scenario.
- WHat is difference between Object Detection and Classification?
- How Object Detection task evolved from single object detection to multiple object Detection?
- Understanding the initial approach of modified CNN using regressor to solve bounding box problem
- Problem with computational cost and efficient methods
- RCNN in detail: Search Algorithm, CNN Classification, SVM Classification, NMS, BBR
- Evaluation Metrics for Object Detection: mAP, IOU
